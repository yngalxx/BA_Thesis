Codes of scrapers from my BA thesis

## Files:
First_Steps_In_BS4.py, Selenium.py and Scrapy.py are only to present basics of those methods. 

## Main part
Main part of my BA thesis is PremierLeagueDataScraper which scrapes data from premierleague.com/stats about appearances of forwards in English Premier League in current season (In my case it was 2019/20). I created this scraper in order to collect data to subsequent analysis to find the most universal attacker in the league. It's an example of using web scraping in football scouting process. To open web scraper You have to run Initialize_PremierLeagueDataScraper.py.

### DataCleaner.py
Merging lots of csv files containing scraped data to one, cleaning scraped data etc.
